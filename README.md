# LeetCode Solutions 

Welcome to the **LeetCode Solutions** repository! This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in **C++**. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for learning, practicing, and improving problem-solving and coding skills.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- Each problem is contained in its own directory, named after the problem's **LeetCode ID** and title (e.g., `66-plus-one`).
- Each directory includes:
  - A `README.md` file describing the problem, including examples and constraints.
  - A `.cpp` file containing the solution to the problem.

### Example
```
├── 35-search-insert-position
│   ├── README.md
│   └── search-insert-position.cpp
├── 66-plus-one
│   ├── README.md
│   └── plus-one.cpp
└── README.md
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any solution:
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mayursoni5/LeetCode.git
    cd LeetCode
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to run.
3. Compile the `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC):
    ```bash
    g++ problem-file.cpp -o solution
    ./solution
    ```

## ✨ Example Problems

### [66. Plus One](https://leetcode.com/problems/plus-one) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)
You are given a **large integer** represented as an array of digits, ordered from most significant to least significant. Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

#### Example
```plaintext
Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: 123 + 1 = 124
```

### [35. Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-brightgreen)
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

#### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```
